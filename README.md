# Intro

This project provides an online implement of various board games. It was written
as a hobby/learning project.

The project was created using create-react-app, but was later ported to Vite.

The project originally used boardgame.io, but that was replaced with home-grown 
code as boardgame.io is no longer being maintained. The currect code is still
influenced by the design of boardgame.io.

An earlier version of this project is deployed at
https://richards-board-games.herokuapp.com/
